* What is this?
Inspired by [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]], this repo provides a python library to convert org-roam collections into graphs workable in numerical python libraries like =numpy=.

See a demo [[file:demo.org][here]].
* Features
- Adjacency matrix of the org-roam network (directed or undirected)
- Distance matrix of network (directed or undirected)
- Filter network by tags, inclusive or exclusive

* Prerequisites
- A healthy =org-roam2= database
- Python 3.7+
- =scipy=

* Wish list
- More robust filtering options by other org properties, or even custom org properties
- Ability to interface with emacs
- Housekeeping, like exception handling and edge case handling

* Credits

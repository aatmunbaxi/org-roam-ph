* What is this?
Inspired by [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]], this repo provides a python library to convert org-roam collections into graphs workable in numerical python libraries like =numpy=.

See a demo [[file:demo.org][here]].
* Features
- Adjacency matrix of the org-roam network (directed or undirected)
- Distance matrix of network (directed or undirected)
- Filter network by tags, inclusive or exclusive

* Prerequisites
- A directory where you keep org-roam notes
  - =org-roam= notes are those characterized by having an =:ID:=  file property generated by =org-roam=, and having a file extension =.org=
  - The library /should/ be robust against outliers, but as this is early-stage, it's recommended all files in the directory are =org-roam= notes
- Python 3.7+
- [[https://github.com/karlicoss/orgparse][orgparse]], an =org-mode= parser for python
- =scipy=

* Wish list
- Refactor retrieval of org files and properties to use the =org-roam-db= (might be unnecessary)
- More robust filtering options by other org properties, or even custom org properties
- Ability to interface with emacs
- Housekeeping, like exception handling and edge case handling

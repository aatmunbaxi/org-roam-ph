* What is this?
Inspired somewhat by [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]], this repo provides a python library to convert org-roam collections into graphs, represented by their adjacency matrices.

See a demo [[file:demo.org][here]].
* Features
- Adjacency matrix of the org-roam network (directed or undirected)
- Distance matrix of network (directed or undirected)
- Filter network by tags, inclusive or exclusive

* Dependencies
- Python 3.5+
- [[https://github.com/karlicoss/orgparse][orgparse]], an =org-mode= parser for python
- =scipy=

* Wishlist
- More robust filtering options by other org properties, or maybe even custom org properties
  - Regex might be a good next step
- Give ability to interface with emacs
- Housekeeping, like exception handling and edge case handling
